Use efficient cache lifetimes
A long cache lifetime can speed up repeat visits to your page. Learn more about caching. Unscored
Layout shift culprits
Layout shifts occur when elements move absent any user interaction. Investigate the causes of layout shifts, such as
elements being added, removed, or their fonts changing as the page loads.CLS Unscored
Document request latency
Your first network request is the most important. Reduce its latency by avoiding redirects, ensuring a fast server response,
and enabling text compression.Unscored
Optimize DOM size
A large DOM can increase the duration of style calculations and layout reflows, impacting page responsiveness. A large
DOM will also increase memory usage. Learn how to avoid an excessive DOM size. INP Unscored

Consider setting font-display to swap or optional to ensure text is consistently visible. swap can be further optimized to
mitigate layout shifts with font metric overrides. INP Unscored
Forced reflow
A forced reflow occurs when JavaScript queries geometric properties (such as offsetWidth) after styles have been
invalidated by a change to the DOM state. This can result in poor performance. Learn more about forced reflows and
possible mitigations.Unscored
Improve image delivery
Reducing the download time of images can improve the perceived load time of the page and LCP. Learn more about
optimizing image sizeUnscored
LCP breakdown
Each subpart has specific improvement strategies. Ideally, most of the LCP time should be spent on loading the resources,
not within delays.Unscored
LCP request discovery
Optimize LCP by making the LCP image discoverable from the HTML immediately, and avoiding lazy-loadingUnscored
Legacy JavaScript
Polyfills and transforms enable older browsers to use new JavaScript features. However, many aren't necessary for modern
browsers. Consider modifying your JavaScript build process to not transpile Baseline features, unless you know you must
support older browsers. Learn why most sites can deploy ES6+ code without transpilingUnscored

HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 offer many benefits over HTTP/1.1, such as multiplexing. Learn more about using modern HTTP.

Preconnected origins
preconnect hints help the browser establish a connection earlier in the page load, saving time when the first
request for that origin is made. The following are the origins that the page preconnected to.
no origins were preconnected
Preconnect candidates
Add preconnect hints to your most important origins, but try to use no more than 4.
No additional origins are good candidates for preconnecting
Render blocking requests
Requests are blocking the page's initial render, which may delay LCP. Deferring or inlining can move these network requests
out of the critical path.Unscored

3rd party code can significantly impact load performance. Reduce and defer loading of 3rd party code to prioritize your

Uses HTTPS
All sites should be protected with HTTPS, even ones that don't handle sensitive data. This includes avoiding mixed content,
where some resources are loaded over HTTP despite the initial request being served over HTTPS. HTTPS prevents intruders
from tampering with or passively listening in on the communications between your app and your users, and is a prerequisite
for HTTP/2 and many new web platform APIs. Learn more about HTTPS.
Avoids deprecated APIs
Deprecated APIs will eventually be removed from the browser. Learn more about deprecated APIs.
